# Privacy Policy
## Data Collection
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or user data. Any settings saved (such as the `On/Off toggle`) are stored locally on your device and are never sent to external severs.
## Functionality
The extension only applies local CSS styling to web pages to provide a retro aesthetic. To function correctly, it uses the following permissions:
- `Storage`: Used only remeber your preference for the `On/Off toggle`
- `Tabs/Scripting` Used only to `refresh` the current page when the theme is toggled so the changes take effect immediately.
It operates entirely within the user's browser and does not communicate with any external servers.
## Third Parties
No data is shared with third parties because no data is collected. This extension contains links to external websites (`GitHub`, `Discord`, `YouTube`, `Blogger`, `Google Sites`). Clicking these links will take you to those `platforms`, which have their own independent privacy policies.
